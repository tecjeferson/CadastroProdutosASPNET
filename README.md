# CadastroProdutosASPNET

This is a simples system in **Asp.Net Core 2** that manages products, I didn't know C# so I just had one week to learn C# and Asp.Net Core, so the project will be a simple CRUD, with routes...

Using a class Produto.cs as a template model for **Entity Framework** it creates all code for database creating and with a simple command as "dotnet ef database update" Entity creates everything like magic...

My personal experience with C# and .Net, it has an incredible learning curve, maybe because of ~~Microsoft has everything structured and tries to make user's life easier...~~ (No... it's not the reason), actually I really want to learn C# and .Net because of the possibility of a challenge in my current job and another factor was I already study Java OO, knows Object Orientation helped me a lot...

The next step will be creating some system more complex.
